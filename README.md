- Created a AWS account, the domain tarrie.io is available via AWS Route 53 thank the lord! However its $40 bucks should I pay for it? 
- Converted RAML to Swagger very easy to do. The API I created before is close to complete but missing details on authentication so I'll spend my time filling those in- here comes AWS Cognito!
- AWS Cognito has JWT tokens which is what I was looking for,however,  I want to add some claims to the payload of the token so I'm trying to figure that out. 
    - Found how to add claims to token -> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-token-generation.html , needs lambda or access to AWS CLI. Lambda will get expensive so just use AWS CLI have to verify that I can access CLI from a EC2 Instance (aka BeanStalk).
        - Turns out I can: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45844779/is-it-possible-to-execute-aws-cli-commands-on-an-ec2-instance-without-placing-aw
        - So lets just develop on local machine using AWS CLI then set up the IAM roles later. 
- To start lets create a api endpoint for groups -- becoming admin, owner, club member, subscribe -- most if not all need jwt access. 
    - Took a while to get the tomcat server env up and running but I got a hello world example up. Now lets implement the api schema for groups
    - Actually now lets set up swagger integration w/ jersey and then we can be done for the day
    - Finished. so got the java server env set up so things should be fast. btw mvn is surpsingly annoying. found out how to define datamodels for swagger to! use this link tommorow now the api generation will be semantic https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/documenting-spring-boot-rest-api-swagger-springfox/
        - TOMMORROW: GET api for group membership going, use AMAZON CLI TO add group membership to the payload of jwt token. honestly not sure this matter that much but i guess if people really want their groups to be secure. whatever.
