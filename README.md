- Created a AWS account, the domain tarrie.io is available via AWS Route 53 thank the lord! However its $40 bucks should I pay for it? 
- Converted RAML to Swagger very easy to do. The API I created before is close to complete but missing details on authentication so I'll spend my time filling those in. So here comes AWS Cognito
- AWS Cognito has JWT tokens which is what I was looking for. But I want to add some claims to the payload of the token so I'm trying to figure that out
